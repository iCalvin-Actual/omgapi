# ``StatusLog``

The most active space in `omg.lol`

[statuslog](https://status.lol) is a feature that allows omg.lol Account owners to share short ``Status`` updates from any ``AddressName`` they have registered. 

These statuses contain a snippet of Markdown text and an accompanying ``Status/emoji``, alongside other metadata.

Conceptually, within `omgapi`, a `StatusLog` is any array of `Status` instances. However, some `api` functions mention the general `statuslog`. That will typically refer to the feed generated by ``api/completeStatuslog()``

## Topics

There are three ways to request the a `statuslog`.

### Complete statuslog

Get a pure feed of the latest activity

```swift
let posts: [AddressName: Int] = client.completeStatuslog().reduce(into: [:]) {
  // Count up the number of recent posts from each Address
  var nxt = $0
  let cnt = $0[$1.address] ?? 0
  nxt[$1.address] = cnt + 1
  return nxt
}
```

To get a complete picture of recent activity `api.completeStatusLog()` will return the 100 most recent `Status` instances, with no other filter or check.

This is the best way to see who is most actively posting new Statuses, but has a smaller total number of statuses returned. 

- ``api/completeStatuslog()``

### Latest statuslog

Consider this the best window into the `statuslog`

```swift
guard let latest = client.latestStatusLog().first else { return }
print("\(latest.emoji) \(latest.content)")
```

The primary behavior of `statuslog` is to show no more than one `Status` per ``AddressName``.  the most recent `Status` instances shared on the statuslog, with no more than one `Status` per ``AddressName``. 

You'll see the `Status` posts shared by the 250 most recently active Addresses, consider this the best window into the `statuslog`.

- ``api/latestStatuslog()``

### Individual statuslog

Fetch the statuslog from a particular address.

There is no limit on the number of results, depending on the address this may be a large response.
